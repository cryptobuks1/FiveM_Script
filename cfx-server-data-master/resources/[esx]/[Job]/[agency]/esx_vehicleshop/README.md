Resource developed by Duart3x https://github.com/Duart3x

## Requirements

Auto mode (everyone can buy vehicles from the dealer)

Mythic Notify -> https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_notify

## Problems

There are some parts of the script that are not translated to english, they are in portuguese

## Download & Installation

- Import d3x_vehicleshop.sql in your database
- In your data base you will see that in your vehicles table there are a new column ‘imglink’ in that column you will put the image path like[imgs/mercerdes.png ] put the image in the HTM/imgs folder and add that file to your fxmanifest.lua, if you want you can use a img link like https://i.imgur.com/T6qCcNb.jpg that will work fine

- Add this in your server.cfg:
```start d3x_vehicleshop```
